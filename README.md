# Art

## About:
##### This Repo contains all my personal art project created with the P5JS library. 
##### After creating my own NFT project called SERPEN : https://opensea.io/collection/serpen : I decided to move onto a new NFT project.
##### This new NFT Project is called SELF FEEL : https://opensea.io/collection/self-feel : I wanted a new way to express myself and creating this allows that. 
##### Along with giving me practice, this project has greatly exposed me to how programming can be used to connect with others which I find very exciting.

## How it works:
##### I have created a starting template for all art programs I plan to use to make into NFTs.
##### The template allows me to easily convert all art produced into jpgs with the press of a button with the necessary name.
##### It not only allows for a single jpg but it also allows me to create multiple frames so that I can convert it into a gif.
##### I currently don't understand how automatically list the jpg onto OpenSea automatically for me using the Polygon Blockchain, and all tutorials have been confusing to follow. 
##### So I manually list each piece along with its properties.

## What to expect:
##### I plan on continuing to make programs to create unique pieces of art work with each RUN and listing them.
##### New art and programs will be made over time. I don't plan on having a set goal since I want to invest more time in learning and expanding my knowledge in Computer Science.
